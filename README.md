# Ollama-Driven-Medical-Insight-using-LLM-and-Federated-Learning-Approach

Traditional medical diagnostics often suffer from
 delays and inconsistencies due to the manual interpretation of
 unstructured patient data. To overcome these challenges, we intro
duce Our Model (given name as ’AI Doctor’)—a novel diagnostic
 system built on the Ollama platform that integrates multiple pre
trained large language models (meditron, medllama2, wizardlm2,
 and mistral) through an innovative prompt filtering mechanism. AI
 Doctor accurately interprets patient-reported symptoms to deliver
 precise diagnoses and personalized treatment recommendations,
 while its design supports robust local deployment and includes
 a theoretical framework for federated learning. This federated
 approach facilitates decentralized, privacy-preserving model up
dates across healthcare institutions. Performance evaluations using
 BLEUscores, structured output analysis, and inference speed mea
surements demonstrate that AI Doctor consistently outperforms
 individual models, ensuring high diagnostic accuracy and realtime
 clinical applicability.
